jQuery plugin to navigate Bootstrap pagination by pressing arrow keys

*Why?*

I've surf alot of website that've a pagination at bottom of the page. To navigate throught those tiny pagination button got me loose focus ... Then I've think that I could try to write a simple srcript to navigate the pagination with my keyboard. Then... here it is :)

How to use ?

It's pretty simple.. 

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
